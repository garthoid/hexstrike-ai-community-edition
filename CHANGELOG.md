# Changelog

## 1.8.0 - exploitotter (NEXT)

### Topology map
- Added a network topology map — export a completed nmap/nmap-advanced run to a live host/port graph, auto-creating a session if needed.
- Toggle on the Run page to auto-export scan results, plus manual "Export to Topology" buttons on the Run page and session tool runs.
- New "Topology" tab on the session detail page renders the graph.

## 1.7.0 - phishfalcon (2026-07-28)

### Navigation
- Replaced the top nav tab bar with a collapsible sidebar — icon-only rail on desktop (state persists across reloads), slide-out drawer on mobile.

### Themes
- Added new themes — Dracula, Rosé, and more.
- Every theme now has a subtle animated accent sweep across the top bar and sidebar edge, respecting the OS "reduce motion" setting.

### Intelligence
- The Decision Engine now weighs the current session's run history when scoring tools — a tool that just failed is deprioritized (not excluded) on the next recommendation.

### Run page & live output
- Run page tool execution now streams live output and progress instead of blocking silently until the command finishes.
- Fixed the process dashboard/stream showing a fake "Running for Xs" placeholder — `last_output` now carries the tool's real stdout/stderr, visible live on the Tasks page.
- Selecting a tool on the Run page now updates the URL to `#/run/<tool>` — bookmarkable/shareable, reopens straight into that tool with empty inputs (no params prefilled).

### Accessibility
- Added focus-trap keyboard navigation to the Command Palette and Chat widget.

### Error recovery
- Fixed `/api/error-handling/execute-with-recovery` raising a server error on every real call.
- Wired automatic error recovery (retry/backoff, alternative-tool swap) into recon, scanning, fuzzing, and forensics tool executions.

### Process pool
- Fixed `/api/process/execute-async` returning the cached result payload instead of a task ID on a cache hit, which broke polling it via `/api/process/get-task-result/<task_id>`.
- Fixed the process pool's worker auto-scaling miscounting active workers after scaling down.
- All tool command execution now runs through the process pool's auto-scaling (previously bypassed it); pooled task results no longer leak memory on long-running instances.

### Internals
- Migrated the entire tool registry to a unified `ToolSpec`-driven registration system, replacing legacy per-category registration code across all tool categories.

## 1.6.0 - injectlynx (2026-07-03)

### New tools
- Integrated `breachsql` — SQLi detection and exploitation across all major backends with boolean, time-blind, union, error, and OOB techniques; `--exploit` and `--dump` support.
- Integrated `stingxss` — context-aware XSS scanner covering reflected, DOM, stored, and blind XSS with WAF evasion, probe filtering, and headless browser confirmation.
- Integrated `phaseaccess` — IDOR/BOLA scanner with dual-session confirmed findings, JWT tampering, method bypass, and parameter pollution checks.
- Integrated `vaultrip` — post-exploitation credential harvesting across files, process memory, browsers, system keyrings, Kerberos caches, and offline dumps.

### Settings
- Added per-tool binary path overrides — configure custom executable paths per tool from the Settings UI with a live Test button that validates the path exists and is executable.
- Fixed `httpx` PATH resolution — falls back to system PATH when no override is set instead of erroring out.

### Performance
- Optimised `RunHistoryPanel` and `RunPage` rendering to reduce unnecessary re-renders on large run histories.

### Internals
- Tools using exit code 1 for "findings found" now report `✅ SUCCESS` in logs — no false failure noise.
- Added `FINDINGS_EXIT_CODE_TOOLS` checks it before logging and setting the success flag.

## 1.5.0 - backdoorbear (2026-05-09)

- Enabled "think" mode and reasoning support in LLM backends (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic).
- And a few smaller features build into the chat.

### LLM analysis
- Added `analyze_session` — passive LLM analysis pass that reads existing workflow session run logs, interprets them, and persists structured findings.
- Added `llm_agent_scan_result` tool — retrieve results of completed LLM agent scan sessions.

- Improved tool injection logic with confidence threshold and conversational pattern filtering.

### Session management
- Added follow-up session functionality — chain sessions for iterative engagements.
- Added session notes management, report generation, findings, and timeline view.
- Added AI analysis section surfacing vulnerabilities and risk level in session cards.

### Plugin system
- Introduced a drop-in plugin architecture — extend NyxStrike without touching core code.
- Drop a folder under `plugins/tools/`, add an entry to `plugins.yaml`, and restart; the server auto-loads the plugin.
- Each tool plugin provides a Flask Blueprint (API endpoint) and a FastMCP registration (AI-callable tool).
- Failed plugins are skipped with a warning — server always starts cleanly.
- Bundled `example_net_ping` plugin as a copy-paste starting point.

### New tools
- Added `schemathesis` integration — property-based API fuzzing against OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas.
- Added `interactsh` wrapper — OOB interaction URL generation for blind SSRF/XSS detection.
- Added `http_headers` tool — fetches and displays HTTP response headers for a target URL.
- Added `dig` tool — DNS lookup via `dig` with configurable record type and nameserver.
- Added Burp Agent Loop API for autonomous pentesting integration.

### Performance and internals
- Implemented thread-safe lazy singleton pattern for service objects.
- Optimized SSE endpoints with unified stream for processes and pool stats, reducing duplicate events.
- Added CPU niceness adjustment and performance dashboard recording to command execution.
- Configurable session wait time for Metasploit execution.
