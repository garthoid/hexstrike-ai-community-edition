# NyxStrike

### AI-powered offensive security orchestration engine

</div>

## What is NyxStrike?

NyxStrike connects LLM agents to real offensive security tools and executes full attack chains — from recon to exploitation.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Installation)

> Get a full offensive security environment running in minutes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CommonHuman-Lab/nyxstrike.git
cd nyxstrike

./nyxstrike.sh -a               # Setup + start server
./nyxstrike.sh -a -t            # + install external tools

```

> Full flag reference: [Wiki — Installation & Flags](https://github.com/CommonHuman-Lab/nyxstrike/wiki/Installation-and-Flags)

### Verify Setup

Open [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to access the dashboard.

> Some tools (e.g. `nmap`, `masscan`) require elevated privileges for specific scan modes. Use a dedicated test VM and least-privilege setup where possible.

---

## 🔌 AI Agent Integrations (MCP)

Connect NyxStrike to any MCP-compatible AI client — OpenCode, Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, Roo Code, and more.

> Open [http://localhost:8888/#/help](http://localhost:8888/#/help) for help with configurations.

### Universal MCP Command

```bash
/path/to/nyxstrike/nyxstrike-env/bin/python3 \
  /path/to/nyxstrike/nyxstrike_mcp.py \
  --server http://127.0.0.1:8888 \
  --profile full
```

### OpenCode

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "nyxstrike": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "/path/to/nyxstrike/nyxstrike-env/bin/python3",
        "/path/to/nyxstrike/nyxstrike_mcp.py",
        "--server",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8888",
        "--profile",
        "full"
      ],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

> NyxStrike gives AI agents direct access to offensive security tooling.

- Run only in isolated environments or dedicated security testing VMs  
- AI agents may execute real commands — maintain operator oversight  
- Monitor activity via dashboard and logs in real time  
- Use `NYXSTRIKE_API_TOKEN` for any non-local deployment
